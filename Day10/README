The main.py file for this days study were the modules: Turtle and Colorgram.

In additon, I chose to personalize the experience by grabbing color data from
the new Spider-Man 2 game and importing a spiderman icon as the turtle shape.

The game itself deserves recognition for gameplay and quality but also
for portraying POC culture and differently-abled perspectives with care and effort .
